   Doing chores also helps develop children’s gratitude to their parents. When doing housework, they
   learn to appreciate all the hard work their parents do around the house for them. In addition, doing
   chores together helps SI aril, creating special moments between children and
   parents. It makes children feel they are members of a team.
   Allin all, doing housework can bring a lot of benefits to children. It teaches them life skills and helps
   build their Character. Therefore, parents should encourage their kids to share the housework for their
   own good as well as the good of the whole family.

American Idol was shown for the first time on television in January 2002. At that time, there were
many movies and TV series, but no reality competitions on TV. The participants in this programme
are ordinary people who the audience can really identify with.
First, judges travel all round America in search of the best singers and bring them to Hollywood.
Twenty-four to thirty-six participants are then chosen to go on to the next stages where they
perform live on TV, and receive the judges’ opinions. From the semi-final onwards, people over 13
and living in the US, Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands can vote for their preferred singers online or
through text messaging. The singer with the lowest number of votes is eliminated. On the final night,
the most popular singer becomes the winner of that American Idol season.
People watch American Ido/ not only to see the participants sing, but also to hear the comments of
the judges, who play an important role in the competition. Their different opinions and interesting
arguments make the show very exciting.
The first season of Vietnam Idol was shown in 2007. It included three stages: short performances to
choose participants, semi-finals and finals. The winners of the show’s different seasons have become
famous singers in Viet Nam.

  COLLECT WATER TO LIVE A GREEN Lire
  Water is essential for life. Therefore, the methods of collecting water are important for meeting its
  growing need.
  The traditional method involves collecting rainwater and storing it for later use. Rainwater is
  collected from a roof and sent to a container. Collected rainwater is an excellent source of water for
  people, animals, and plants.
  There is also anew method of collecting water. It can turn the tiny drops of water in the air into
  drinking water. Air-to-water technology creates water from air and releases it all the time. It uses the
  sun’s energy and works well evenin dry conditions.
  In general, collecting rainwater or creating water from air will allow people to save natural resources,
  improve the environment, and live a green life.

   Twenty years later, a robot named Sophia can even communicate with people by using human
   language and expressing emotions.
   However, robots are just one example of Artificial Intelligence (Al) - the study and development of
   machines that can copy human intelligence. Nowadays, Al has been applied to various areas of life.
   At home, devices such as vacuum cleaners can now use Al to measure the room size and recognise
   any furniture. They can then decide on the most effective way to clean the house.
   In transport, Al can be used on many smartphones to collect information about traffic. This can then
   help drivers find the most suitable route. Travelling has become much more convenient thanks to Al.
   At work, the uses of Al are even more useful and exciting. Computer programmes, such as Al software or
   chatbots, can help customers plan their holidays, book flights and hotels, and answer questions.
   Alis one of the most important inventions of the 21st century. It has completely changed our daily

   Gender equality has been greatly promoted around the world. However, there are still many
   challenges that women face.
   First of all, there are still girls who.are forced to get married before the age of 18. In many
   places, parents may see child marriage as a way to protect their daughters from violence.
   However, many of these young girls become victims of HERESIES Child marriage
   also carries serious health risks as young girls are not physically developed to give birth.
   Secondly, more than half of the world’s Uneducated people are women. This means fewer
   girls than boys go to school or stay long at school. Girls who receive an education are less
   likely to marry young. They can also have better job skills and can earn higher salaries.
   Education gives girls the opportunity to have a better life and give back to their communities.
   Thirdly, women are often paid less than men. In other
   words, women have to work longer than men to earn
   -S _ **\_ _ the same amount of money. Differences in career
   in _ \_** _ choices might be one reason. Women tend to become
   / \\ _ **\_ _ nurses, secretaries, or shop assistants, which are
   | _ \_** _ l _ **\_ _ N _ \_** _ oOW=paying jobs, while men choose high-paying
   Sd _ **\_ _ careers as surgeons, airline pilots, or engineers.
   —— _ \_** \_ Women are still not equal tomen in today’s society,
   and governments, organisations and individuals must
   work together to achieve gender equality.

WOMEN'S FOOTBALL
It is commonly thought that football is a sport for men. In fact, it is a sport for women, too.
The first recorded football matches between women took place in 1890s in Scotland and England.
Women’s football became very popular during the First World War when women started working in the
factories. In 1921, however, the Football Association (FA) decided that the game was not suitable for
women.
The ban lasted for 50 years until it was finally lifted in 1971. In the same year, France and the
Netherlands played the first official women’s international football match. However, it took 20
yeas for the first FIFA Women’s World Cup to happen in 1991 in Asia. Since then, the competition
as been held every four years.
Nowadays, like men’s football, women’s football is becoming more and more popslats Women’s
professional football has developed significantly and the Women’s World Cup has drawn _ \_** _ o

MODERN SCHOOLS
Modern schools are designed to help each student to be successful. Teachers play the role of a guide
for them and prepare them for lifelong learning. They encourage and challenge them to become
responsible and confident individuals.
Class discussion is a main feature of modern schools. Students are expected to take part in
discussions and express personal opinions. It is also important to ask questions in class if students do
not understand any point or instruction. Group learning is another common feature. Students may
work in small groups on a project task.
In class, teachers and students use computers to access digital learning resources. Teachers use
technology and audio-visual materials to support their lessons. Outside the classroom, students have
a chance to participate in field trips to famous landmarks such as museums, hospitals, and industry
locations. These trips give them real-world experiences. Students also attend school camps to make
friends with other students and to develop life skills in unfamiliar environments.

1. What is the role of teachers in modern schools?
2. What are two common features of modern schools?
3. How do students use computers in the learning process?
4. How do students learn about the real world?
   2 Work in groups. Discuss whether your school has similar features and learning

   a. Environmental problems: What are they?
   b. Environmental protection: How important is it? _ _\_\_ _ :
   c. Environmental solutions: How practical are they?
   The environment we live in is facing many serious problems. We need to be aware of these problems
   so that we can find ways to protect nature.
   A. Global warming is the rise in the average temperature of the earth’s atmosphere. It is one of the
   biggest issues facing humans today. It can have serious consequences such as rising sea levels,
   Polar ice melting and extreme weather events like floods or heatwaves.
   B. Another environmental problem is the cutting and clearing of natural forests. The loss of forests
   can have a negative impact on the environment. It can damage the natural habitats of many
   animals and put wildlife in danger. It can also destroy the natural soil and lead to climate change.
   C. Air pollution is also a serious problem. It is mainly caused by waste gases that come out of
   vehicles, machines or factories. When these harmful gases combine with the water in the air,
   they come down as rain or snow, which can damage all forms of life. In addition, this problem
   leads to global warming and climate change. It is also a major cause of respiratory diseases or
   even lung cancer.
   D. Around the world, the number of endangered animals is rising. Many of them disappear because
   of pollution and climate change. In addition, humans illegally hunt and kill animals, and catch too
   many fish at once. This is upsetting the natural balance of ecosystems, which can be harmful to
   all living and non-living things.

- Review 4
  1 Read the text. Match the highlighted words in the text with their meanings.
  The more people travel, the bigger impact they may have on the environment. How can we
  reduce it while travelling? Here are some advice.
  Reduce your carbon footprint while travelling. Since flying produces more carbon footprint
  than any other means of transport, you should only fly when the trip is long. During the trip,
  you should walk, cycle or use public transport as much as you can. This not only helps to
  keep the environment clean, but also allows you to enjoy the beauty of nature and SE
  with local people.
  Choose eco-friendly activities that benefit animals and the ecosystem. Avoid activities that
  allow you to touch or ride animals because they disturb their natural patterns and attract
  many people. Instead, visit wildlife parks or organic farms. These will help you understand
  and respect the nature more and stop doing things that harm the environment.
