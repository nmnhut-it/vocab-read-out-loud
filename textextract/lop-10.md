Benefits of doing housework

1 Work in pairs. Look at the picture and answer the questions.

1. What is each person in the picture doing?

2. Do you think that they are happy? Why or
   why not?

2 Read the text and tick (Vv)
the appropriate meanings of
the highlighted words.

Most people think that housework is boring and
is the responsibility of wives and mothers only.
Many parents don’t ask their children to do
housework so that they have more time to play
or study. However, studies show doing chores is
good for children.

Kids who do housework develop important life
skills that they will need for the rest of their lives.
Doing the laundry, cleaning the house, and taking
care of others are among the important skills
that children will need when they start their own
families. These are the things that schools cannot
fully teach, so it’s important for children to learn
them at home. Sharing housework also helps
young people learn to take responsibility. They
know that they have to try to finish their tasks
even though they do not enjoy doing them. ;

Doing chores also helps develop children’s gratitude to their parents. When doing housework, they
learn to appreciate all the hard work their parents do around the house for them. In addition, doing
chores together helps Strengthen family bonds, creating special moments between children and
parents. It makes children feel they are members of a team.

Allin all, doing housework can bring a lot of benefits to children. It teaches them life skills and helps
build their character. Therefore, parents should encourage their kids to share the housework for their
own good as well as the good of the whole family.

Subject: My family routines

Hi Dong,

How are you getting on? In your last email you
asked me about my family routines. Well, we have
quite a few routines to help us learn life skills and
build family bonds, but I'll tell you about three

main ones.

First, my family always have dinner together.
Dinners are important for us since we share our
daily experiences and talk about the latest news.
Second, we watch our favourite game show on
TV together every Friday evening. We discuss the

questions and guess the answers. It’s great fun
every time we get a correct answer. Third, every
two weeks, on Saturday we clean the house
together. We make a list of all the chores. Each of
us then chooses one or two household tasks
according to personal choice. We all feel happy
and proud when we see our home spotlessly clean
at the end of the day.

Do you have similar family routines? I’d be
interested to know about your family.

Please write back soon.

Best,

Joey

1 Read the text and list the five family
values of British people in the 21st
century in the table below.

BRITISH FAMILY VALUES

Family values are ideas about how people
want to live their family life and are passed
on from parents to children. Strong family
values can prepare children for a happy life.
Results of a recent survey in the UK show
that even though modern family life has
changed greatly, anumber of traditional
family values are still important in the UK
nowadays.

On top of the list are the values of being
truthful and honest, and respecting older
people. Children are taught to tell the truth
from an early age. They learn to show
respect to older people, who have a wealth
of life experiences. Having good table
manners is the third important family value.
Coming fourth and fifth on the list are the
values of remembering to say please and
thank you, and helping with family chores
respectively.

Itis clear that in the 21st century, British
people still follow some traditional family
values.

2 Work in pairs. Discuss whether
Vietnamese people have similar
family values.

more Sustainable lifestyle. There are many things you can do to become an eco-friendly person.
Here are some of them.
Turning off your appliances when they are notin use
This is one of the easiest ways to save energy and reduce your carbon footprint. It also helps reduce
energy bills and prevent any dangerous situations such as a fire or an explosion.
Buying products that are grown using more natural and/organi¢ methods
This helps reduce the use of harmful chemicals in food. Organic food is better for us because it is safer
and healthier. It also tastes better.

plastic use
This really helps the environment because it takes many years for plastic waste to break down into
small pieces. Bring a reusable bag when you go shopping, and your own refillable bottle instead of
buying bottled water.
Recycling as much as possible
This prevents pollution because it reduces the need to collect new raw materials and protects

such as water and trees. So don’t throw away your used household items, but
sort and recycle them.

CARBQy

A carbon footprint is the eiee &®
amount of CO, produced by
human activities. It also includes
the emissions of other greenhouse
gases. Although calculating your carbon
footprint can be difficult, you can still
estimate it based on how big your family is,
how much electricity your appliances use,
how much you drive or fly, or how much
you recycle.

Globally, the average carbon footprint per
person is more than 4 tons per year. Too
much CO, in the Earth’s atmosphere can cause
serious problems. It can lead to increasing
global temperatures and air pollution, and
destroy the natural world.

It's not difficult to reduce your carbon
footprint. You can do it by making your daily
activities eco-friendly. For example, you can
take shorter showers. The less hot water you
use, the less energy is needed to heat the
water. Instead of using your personal car or
motorbike, you should use public transport,
walk or cycle as muchas possible.

These simple activities can help reduce your
carbon footprint and your impact on the:
environment.

    There are several types of chau van singing. One typical type is hat tho or worship singing

        COLLECT WATER TO LIVE A GREEN LIFE

        Water is essential for life. Therefore, the methods of collecting water are important for meeting its
        growing need.

        The traditional method involves collecting rainwater and storing it for later use. Rainwater is
        collected from a roof and sent to a container. Collected rainwater is an excellent source of water for
        people, animals, and plants.

        There is also anew method of collecting water. It can turn the tiny drops of water in the air into
        drinking water. Air-to-water technology creates water from air and releases it all the time. It uses the
        sun’s energy and works well evenin dry conditions.

        In general, collecting rainwater or creating water from air will allow people to save natural resources,
        improve the environment, and live a green life.

            in Viet Nam in 1990. It provides practical support in different areas. One of the areas that the
            organisation particularly focuses on is education. It has organised different training courses to help
            teachers improve their teaching skills and use digital technology in their classrooms. It is also working on
            projects that create more opportunities for children in remote areas to go to school. By providing these
            children with books and other school materials, Save the Children makes sure they have access to learning.
            In addition, the organisation offers training on life-saving skills for both teachers and students in case
            of disasters. Children and households in need can also receive support from Save the Children. save the

            (have / has + past participle) to talk about: - something that happened in the past, but is still true or
            important now. Example: | have lost my key. Now | can‘t open the door. something that started in the past,
            and is still happening now (often used with since or for). Example: They have lived here for a year. -
            something that was completed in the very recent past (often used with just or recently). Example: He has
            just finished his homework. Circle the correct answers. 1. They just found / have just found a suitable

            enjoy, and finish. Example! enjoy cooking. - as subjects of sentences. Example: Learning English is fun. We
            use fo-infinitives (to + verb): - after verbs such as want, decide, and allow. Example: My parents don’t
            alow me to use a smartphone. - after adjectives to give opinions, starting with It’s... Example: It’s fun to

            example of Artificial Intelligence (Al) -the study and development of machines that can copy human
            intelligence. Nowadays, Al has been applied to various areas of life. At home, devices such as vacuum
            cleaners can now use Al to measure the room size and recognise any furniture. They can then decide on the
            most effective way to clean the house. In transport, Al can be used on many smartphones to collect
            information about traffic. This can then help drivers find the most suitable route. Travelling has become
            much more convenient thanks to Al. At work, the uses of Al are even more useful and exciting. Computer
            programmes, such as Al software or chatbots, can help customers plan their holidays, book flights and
            hotels, and answer questions. Alis one of the most important inventions of the 21st century. It has

            HARDWARE

            A computer needs both hardware and
            software to run, but decisions about the
            hardware must be made before you buy
            a computer. Understanding some basic
            information about the hardware is very
            important and will help you decide on the
            most suitable computer for you.

            Processors: The processor controls all
            of the activities of a computer. Processor
            speed is often shown in gigahertz (GHz).
            High processor speed means that your
            computer can run faster.

            e Random Access Memory, or RAM: It is
            displayed in gigabytes (GB). The RAM
            shows how powerful your computer is.

            The more RAM in a computer, the more tasks
            your computer can do at the same time.

            ¢ Storage space: It shows how much
            information (such as documents, music,
            photos, etc.) a computer can Store. It is
            also displayed in gigabytes (GB).

            There is other information about the
            hardware, such as the screen size, the
            battery, and the weight, that you need to
            know before choosing the best computer
            for you.

            There are two types of community service. The first one is a kind of punishment. For example, people
            who litter may be forced to clean up the streets. In this case, they may not feel happy about the work.
            The second type of community service i rary This means people oe lng, or pleased to do
            the work. For instance, people may volunteer to build houses for poor people, or raise money for
            children in mountainous areas.

            However, it does not mean that volunteering is always a Selfless act because volunteers may also
            benefit from the volunteering activities. For example, they may volunteer to meet new people, to
            develop social skills, or to ‘find themselves’ (learn what they truly want in life). In general, people

            may volunteer not just to help others, but also to help themselves.

            Gender equality has been greatly promoted around the world. However, there are still many
            challenges that women face.

            First of all, there are still girls who.are forced to get married before the age of 18. In many
            places, parents may see child marriage as a way to protect their daughters from violence.
            However, many of these young girls become victims of HaRESBSIE Child marriage
            also carries serious health risks as young girls are not physically developed to give birth.

            Secondly, more than half of the world’s uneducated people are women. This means fewer
            girls than boys go to school or stay long at school. Girls who receive an education are less
            likely to marry young. They can also have better job skills and can earn higher salaries.
            Education gives girls the opportunity to have a better life and give back to their communities.

            Thirdly, women are often paid less than men. In other
            words, women have to work longer than men to earn
            the same amount of money. Differences in career
            choices might be one reason. Women tend to become
            nurses, secretaries, or shop assistants, which are
            jobs, while men choose high-paying
            careers as surgeons, airline pilots, or engineers.

            Women are still not equal to men in today’s society,
            and governments, organisations and individuals must
            work together to achieve gender equality.

            WOMEN'S FOOTBALL

            Itis commonly thought that football is a sport for men. In fact, it is a sport for women, too.
            The first recorded football matches between women took place in 1890s in Scotland and England.
            Women’s football became very popular during the First World War when women started working in the
            factories. In 1921, however, the Football Association (FA) decided that the game was not suitable for
            women.
            The ban lasted for 50 years until it was finally lifted in 1971. In the same year, France and the
            Netherlands played the first official women’s international football match. However, it took 20
            Yeas for the first FIFA Women’s World Cup to happenin 1991 in Asia. Since then, the competition

            s been held every four years.
            Nowadays, like men’s football, women’s football is becoming more and more popular. Women’s
            professional football has developed significantly and the Women’s World Cup has drawn ed

            * compare a person or thing with
            another person or thing.

            Example:

            The European markets are usually more

            competitive than the Asian markets.

            The Asian markets are less competitive
            than the European markets.

            * show changes.

            Example:

            Since then, our country has become more active.
            We use superlatives to compare a person
            or thing with the whole group of which that
            person or thing is a member.

            Example:

            This trade organisation includes two of the
            largest economies in the world: the United
            States and China.

            UNICEF supports the most disadvantaged
            children all over the world.

            for smaller member countries.

            2. This job offer is more attractive / the most

            3. Because of poorly designed packaging,

            become one of more popular / the most

            FAO AND ITS ACTIVITIES
            IN VIET NAM

            The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)

            of the United Nations was formed in 1945.

            Its main aim is to end hunger and poverty by
            making sure all people have access to healthy
            food. It hopes to raise the levels of nutrition and
            the standard of living in its member countries.
            Italso tries to improve the production of food
            and agricultural products, and make sure they
            teach all groups of society.

            FAO started working in Viet Nam in 1978.
            Since then, it has provided Viet Nam with
            technical support and advice to the
            government in the field of agriculture. It has
            also helped Viet Nam carry out hundreds of
            Projects in different areas.

            In response to FAO's support, Viet Nam

            has actively participated in FAO activities,
            including food security and nutrition. Food
            security means that all people have access to
            enough and safe food while good nutrition or
            getting the right type of food is essential for
            normal growth and development.

MODERN SCHOOLS

Modern schools are designed to help each student to be successful. Teachers play the role of a guide
for them and prepare them for lifelong learning. They encourage and challenge them to become
responsible and confident individuals.

Class discussion is a main feature of modern schools. Students are expected to take part in
discussions and express personal opinions. It is also important to ask questions in class if students do
not understand any point or instruction. Group learning is another common feature. Students may
work in small groups on a project task.

In class, teachers and students use computers to access digital learning resources. Teachers use
technology and audio-visual materials to support their lessons. Outside the classroom, students have

a chance to participate in field trips to famous landmarks such as museums, hospitals, and industry
locations. These trips give them real-world experiences. Students also attend school camps to make
friends with other students and to develop life skills in unfamiliar environments.

1. What is the role of teachers in modern schools?

2. What are two common features of modern schools?

3. How do students use computers in the learning process?
4. How do students learn about the real world?

A. Global warming is the rise in the average temperature of the earth’s atmosphere. It is one of the
biggest issues facing humans today. It can have serious consequences such as rising sea levels,
Polar ice melting and extreme weather events like floods or heatwaves.

B. Another environmental problem is the cutting and clearing of natural forests. The loss of forests
can have a negative impact on the environment. It can damage the natural habitats of many
animals and put wildlife in danger. It can also destroy the natural soil and lead to climate change.

C. Air pollution is also a serious problem. It is mainly caused by waste gases that come out of
vehicles, machines or factories. When these harmful gases combine with the water in the air,
they come down as rain or snow, which can damage all forms of life. In addition, this problem
leads to global warming and climate change. It is also a major cause of respiratory diseases or
even lung cancer.

D. Around the world, the number of endangered animals is rising. Many of them disappear because
of pollution and climate change. In addition, humans illegally hunt and kill animals, and catch too
many fish at once. This is upsetting the natural balance of ecosystems, which can be harmful to
all living and non-living things.

EARTH, HOUR

Earth Hour is a global event organised by
the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).
Held every year, it encourages people
and businesses to turn off their lights and
other unnecessary electrical devices for
one hour from 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. on
the last Saturday of March. Earth Hour
was started as a lights-out event

in Sydney, Australia, in 2007. Since then,
it has grown to become an international
movement for the environment,
happening in more than 7,000 cities and
towns across 187 countries and territories.

Earth Hour has created a positive
environmental impact. It shows the public
support for protecting the environment
and saving the planet. It also draws
attention to climate change and global
energy issues, and promotes green
activities worldwide.

Viet Nam joined the event in 2009 and has
beenan active and keen supporter since
then. Besides switching off lights, people

can take part ina number of activities
to raise awareness of environmental
problems and call for action for climate,
people and nature.

                industry’, or an environmentally-friendly
                industry, it can actually damage nature.
                However, different kinds of tourism may have
                different effects on the environment.

                e Mass tourism is a kind of tourism which
                involves tens of thousands of people
                crowding the same places at the same
                time of year. It often has a lot of negative
                impact on the local area, suchas litter
                from tourists and pollution from traffic.

                e Ecotourism provides tourists with
                opportunities to explore nature, and at the
                same time helps protect the environment
                and educates travellers on local
                environmental issues. It also promotes
                tourists’ respect for local communities.

                Sustainable tourism involves not only
                environmental protection and cultural
                respect, but also efforts to keep profits
                local. It often refers to actions of the
                tourist industry as a whole.

                e Responsible tourism encourages tourists
                to be more than visitors. Responsible
                tourists should not only be aware of their
                role, but also take part in protecting the
                environment, culture and improving
                the profits for local people. Responsible
                tourism often relates to specific actions of
                individuals, businesses and communities.

                The more people travel, the bigger impact they may have on the environment. How can we
                teduce it while travelling? Here are some advice.

                Reduce your carbon footprint while travelling. Since flying produces more carbon footprint
                than any other means of transport, you should only fly when the trip is long. During the trip,
                you should walk, cycle or use public transport as much as you can. This not only helps to
                keep the environment clean, but also allows you to enjoy the beauty of nature and

                with local people.

                Choose eco-friendly activities that Benefit animals and the ecosystem. Avoid activities that
                allow you to touch or ride animals because they disturb their natural patterns and attract
                many people. Instead, visit wildlife parks or organic farms. These will help you understand
                and respect the nature more and stop doing things that harm the environment.
