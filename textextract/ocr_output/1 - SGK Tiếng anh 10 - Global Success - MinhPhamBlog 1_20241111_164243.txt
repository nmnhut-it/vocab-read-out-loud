American Idol was shown for the first time on television in January 2002. At that time, there were
many movies and TV series, but no reality competitions on TV. The participants in this programme
are ordinary people who the audience can really identify with.
First, judges travel all round America in search of the best singers and bring them to Hollywood.
Twenty-four to thirty-six participants are then chosen to go on to the next stages where they
perform live on TV, and receive the judges’ opinions. From the semi-final onwards, people over 13
and living in the US, Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands can vote for their preferred singers online or
through text messaging. The singer with the lowest number of votes is eliminated. On the final night,
the most popular singer becomes the winner of that American Idol season.
People watch American Ido/ not only to see the participants sing, but also to hear the comments of
the judges, who play an important role in the competition. Their different opinions and interesting
arguments make the show very exciting.
The first season of Vietnam Idol was shown in 2007. It included three stages: short performances to
choose participants, semi-finals and finals. The winners of the show’s different seasons have become
famous singers in Viet Nam.

COLLECT WATER TO LIVE A GREEN Lire
Water is essential for life. Therefore, the methods of collecting water are important for meeting its
growing need.
The traditional method involves collecting rainwater and storing it for later use. Rainwater is
collected from a roof and sent to a container. Collected rainwater is an excellent source of water for
people, animals, and plants.
There is also anew method of collecting water. It can turn the tiny drops of water in the air into
drinking water. Air-to-water technology creates water from air and releases it all the time. It uses the
sun’s energy and works well evenin dry conditions.
In general, collecting rainwater or creating water from air will allow people to save natural resources,
improve the environment, and live a green life.

C. The club organises many volunteering activities that benefit both the community

| joined the Volunteer Club when | started secondary school. The club was formed fifteen years ago,
shortly after the school was set up. Since then, it has organised various volunteering activities for all
students to participate.
One of the most popular activities of our club is selling handmade items to raise money for the local
orphanage and homeless old people. Last year, we also faised over one hundred million VND to help
people in flooded areas. The money was used to buy warm clothes, blankets, food, and clean water.
Our club welcomes different types of donations: clothes, picture books, unused notebooks, and other
unwanted items. At the end of each month, we take the donations to the community centre. Our club
also organises afterschool games for the children at the orphanage and concerts for the old people
at the centre. In addition, it offers other volunteering activities, such as helping at a food bank or
delivering free meals to poor families.
Volunteering has helped me gain life experiences and find my sense of purpose in life. When | see
suffering and hardships, | feel thankful for what | have. What is more, these activities provide opportunities
for me to meet other teenagers with similar interests and help me build essential life skills.

amazed everyone by just walking down the stairs.
Twenty years later, a robot named Sophia can even communicate with people by using human
language and expressing emotions.
However, robots are just one example of Artificial Intelligence (Al) - the study and development of
machines that can copy human intelligence. Nowadays, Al has been applied to various areas of life.
At home, devices such as vacuum cleaners can now use Al to measure the room size and recognise
any furniture. They can then decide on the most effective way to clean the house.
In transport, Al can be used on many smartphones to collect information about traffic. This can then
help drivers find the most suitable route. Travelling has become much more convenient thanks to Al.
At work, the uses of Al are even more useful and exciting. Computer programmes, such as Al software or
chatbots, can help customers plan their holidays, book flights and hotels, and answer questions.
Alis one of the most important inventions of the 21st century. It has completely changed our daily
work and life.

There are two types of community service. The first one is a kind of punishment. For example, people
who litter may be forced to clean up the streets. In this case, they may not feel happy about the work.
The second type of community service ‘salen This means people se ling or pleased to do
the work. For instance, people may volunteer to build houses for poor people, or raise money for
children in mountainous areas.
However, it does not mean that volunteering is always a Selfléss act because volunteers may also
benefit from the volunteering activities. For example, they may volunteer to meet new people, to
develop social skills, or to ‘find themselves’ (learn what they truly want in life). In general, people
may volunteer not just to help others, but also to help themselves.

Gender equality has been greatly promoted around the world. However, there are still many
challenges that women face.
First of all, there are still girls who.are forced to get married before the age of 18. In many
places, parents may see child marriage as a way to protect their daughters from violence.
However, many of these young girls become victims of HERESIES Child marriage
also carries serious health risks as young girls are not physically developed to give birth.
Secondly, more than half of the world’s Uneducated people are women. This means fewer
girls than boys go to school or stay long at school. Girls who receive an education are less
likely to marry young. They can also have better job skills and can earn higher salaries.
Education gives girls the opportunity to have a better life and give back to their communities.
Thirdly, women are often paid less than men. In other
words, women have to work longer than men to earn
-S _ ___ _ the same amount of money. Differences in career
in _ ___ _ choices might be one reason. Women tend to become

WOMEN'S FOOTBALL
It is commonly thought that football is a sport for men. In fact, it is a sport for women, too.
The first recorded football matches between women took place in 1890s in Scotland and England.
Women’s football became very popular during the First World War when women started working in the
factories. In 1921, however, the Football Association (FA) decided that the game was not suitable for
women.
The ban lasted for 50 years until it was finally lifted in 1971. In the same year, France and the
Netherlands played the first official women’s international football match. However, it took 20
yeas for the first FIFA Women’s World Cup to happen in 1991 in Asia. Since then, the competition
as been held every four years.

MODERN SCHOOLS
Modern schools are designed to help each student to be successful. Teachers play the role of a guide
for them and prepare them for lifelong learning. They encourage and challenge them to become
responsible and confident individuals.
Class discussion is a main feature of modern schools. Students are expected to take part in
discussions and express personal opinions. It is also important to ask questions in class if students do
not understand any point or instruction. Group learning is another common feature. Students may
work in small groups on a project task.
In class, teachers and students use computers to access digital learning resources. Teachers use
technology and audio-visual materials to support their lessons. Outside the classroom, students have
a chance to participate in field trips to famous landmarks such as museums, hospitals, and industry
locations. These trips give them real-world experiences. Students also attend school camps to make
friends with other students and to develop life skills in unfamiliar environments.
1. What is the role of teachers in modern schools?
2. What are two common features of modern schools?
3. How do students use computers in the learning process?
4. How do students learn about the real world?

Polar ice melting and extreme weather events like floods or heatwaves.
B. Another environmental problem is the cutting and clearing of natural forests. The loss of forests
can have a negative impact on the environment. It can damage the natural habitats of many
animals and put wildlife in danger. It can also destroy the natural soil and lead to climate change.
C. Air pollution is also a serious problem. It is mainly caused by waste gases that come out of
vehicles, machines or factories. When these harmful gases combine with the water in the air,
they come down as rain or snow, which can damage all forms of life. In addition, this problem
leads to global warming and climate change. It is also a major cause of respiratory diseases or
even lung cancer.
D. Around the world, the number of endangered animals is rising. Many of them disappear because
of pollution and climate change. In addition, humans illegally hunt and kill animals, and catch too
many fish at once. This is upsetting the natural balance of ecosystems, which can be harmful to
all living and non-living things.

Review 4
1 Read the text. Match the highlighted words in the text with their meanings.
The more people travel, the bigger impact they may have on the environment. How can we
reduce it while travelling? Here are some advice.
Reduce your carbon footprint while travelling. Since flying produces more carbon footprint
than any other means of transport, you should only fly when the trip is long. During the trip,
you should walk, cycle or use public transport as much as you can. This not only helps to
keep the environment clean, but also allows you to enjoy the beauty of nature and SE
with local people.
Choose eco-friendly activities that benefit animals and the ecosystem. Avoid activities that
allow you to touch or ride animals because they disturb their natural patterns and attract
many people. Instead, visit wildlife parks or organic farms. These will help you understand
and respect the nature more and stop doing things that harm the environment.

1. What is the main idea of the text?
A. Reducing the environmental impact of tourism
B. Visiting wildlife parks
C. Choosing suitable tourist attractions

A. fly when you travel
B. walk when you arrive at the place
C. ride animals
3. What can be inferred from the text?
A. Tourists are encouraged to watch the shows which are performed by animals.
B. Visits to organic farms or wildlife parks can be harmful to the environment.
C. Tourists should choose activities that are good for local people and the environment.
Write a paragraph (120 - 150 words) about things you should or shouldn’t do to
reduce the negative impact of travelling on the environment. You may use the
ideas in the reading to help you.
